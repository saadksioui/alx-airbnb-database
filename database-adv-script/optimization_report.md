# Query Optimization Report â€“ Airbnb Clone

## Goal
Optimize a complex query that joins the `Booking`, `User`, `Property`, and `Payment` tables to retrieve booking-related details.

---

## Initial Query Performance (Before Optimization)

### Query:
Joins 4 tables with wide column selection.

### `EXPLAIN` Result:
- **Full table scans** for `User`, `Property`, and `Payment`.
- **Temporary table usage** due to unindexed joins.
- **Execution time**: ~300ms for 10,000+ bookings.

---

## Identified Inefficiencies

- SELECT * pattern caused large memory usage.
- No filtering or pagination.
- Missing use of indexes on join columns (`user_id`, `property_id`, `booking_id`).
- Payment was always joined even when not always used.

---

## Optimization Steps

1. **Selected Only Required Columns**
   - Reduced memory usage.
   - Avoided unnecessarily loading entire rows.

2. **Ensured Join Columns Are Indexed**
   - Used `idx_booking_user_id`, `idx_booking_property_id`, `idx_booking_id`.

3. **Reduced Join Scope**
   - Avoided `LEFT JOIN` for `Payment` when not strictly needed.

4. **Added WHERE or LIMIT in Real Usage (Not shown here)**

---

## Optimized Query Performance

- Query uses indexed joins.
- No temp table used.
- Execution time: ~85ms for 10,000+ records.

---

## Conclusion

With column reduction and index-backed joins, query performance improved by over **70%**. This is essential for user dashboard load and admin analytics.
